# To push code to a Git repository, follow these steps:

1. **Initialize Git (if you haven't already):**
   ```bash
   git init
   ```

2. **Add your files:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```
   This stages all changes for the next commit. You can also specify individual files instead of using `.`.

3. **Commit your changes:**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   ```
   Replace `"Your commit message"` with a brief description of what you've changed.

4. **Add a remote repository (if you haven't already):**
   ```bash
   git remote add origin <remote_repository_URL>
   ```
   Replace `<remote_repository_URL>` with the URL of your Git repository.

5. **Push your changes:**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```
   Replace `main` with the branch name you're working on if it's different (e.g., `master` or `dev`).

If you encounter any errors, make sure you have the necessary permissions and that your branch is up-to-date with the remote repository.
